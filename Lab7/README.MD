Boost Converter Analysis

Measurements and Waveforms

1. (6 Points) Run the simulation. Attach a zoomed-in waveform of the PWM driving signal of the MOSFET and estimate the switching frequency;  f_s ~ 50505.05 Hz
Compare the switching frequency of this converter with the one in Lab 4.  The switching frequency in Lab4 is 1E5 Hz.  The switching frequency in this lab is 50.5% of the switching frequency in Lab4.

2. (6 Points) Compare the inductance value with the one in Lab 4. Make comments on the differences based on your observation of assignment 1.

3. (6 Points) What type of diode is used in this circuit? Whatâ€™s major difference between this diode and the one we used in Lab 4?

4. (6 Points) Now replace the diode MBRS340 by 1N914, which is a normal silicon diode. Re-run the simulation and attach a zoomed-in waveform of steady-state voltage. Comment on the steady state voltage ripple. Change the diode back once you are done with this question.

5. (3x2=6 Points) List the advantages and disadvantages of operating at higher frequency.

6. (5 Points) Summarize what you have learned from assignment 1 to 5.
